I’ve dedicated my adult life to learning to build the web. Everything
I’ve studied relates to this field, and every job I’ve taken aligns with
my goal to work in it. Naturally, when you tell someone you’re a web
developer, they say, “Oh, that’s cool. What’s the name of your site?”
I’ve given excuses in the past: “Well, I’m working on it;" "I’m so busy
with clients that I wouldn’t have time to maintain it."

The excuses were honest, and I have been working on my site for more
years than I care to remember. I really haven’t had the time. I work
full-time at [Bureau Blank](http://www.bureaublank.com "Bureau Blank"),
freelance on the side and have more side projects
than are worth naming here. Regardless, they’re still excuses.

More than anything, fear of critism has kept me from making this website a
reality. I like to believe that people expect high quality from the web
developer’s website. I have friends, family and co-workers, past,
present and future, who I’d like to impress.

I’ve met some really talented people in New York, and I’ve realized that
the people who make the best stuff aren’t much more talented than anyone
else. They just make lots and lots of stuff. That’s what I plan to do here.

Here's a rundown, section by section, of what you can expect to see on
this site.

## Blog
That’s what you’re reading now. Expect to see posts and commentary about
topics that are generally interesting to me. My interests generally
revolve around web development, design, science, history, politics and
religion, despite being non-religious myself. I realize that the last
two in that list can be volatile subjects, but that’s not reason enough
to ignore them. Surely some folks will disagree with the way I see the world, 
but that’s not a bad thing. I’ll do my best to make this a place where I 
can learn from you all, and I welcome constructive, healthy debate.

## Articles
Art directed blog posts. For those unfamiliar, think of it as a feature
in a magazine. Expect topics much like the blog, but with more
substance, and design that breaks the mold of the site to cater to the content.

This section is not quite ready yet but will be soon.

## Projects
I’ll showcase the work I’ve done over the years. It’s a portfolio. I
just didn’t want to call it that.

This section still has a way to go.

## Photography
I was really into photography in college, and I still shoot from time to
time. I’d like to share that with you here.

Still working on it.

## Info
Personal information, contact information, etc.

## Design Notes
>Good design is as little design as possible.

This site is purposely devoid of anything but content (photos, information,
writing, etc.) and the navigation that links it together. Every design
decision was made with reading experience in mind.

## Technical Info
This site is built with Jekyll and Jekyll Bootstrap, and it's hosted by
Github Pages. It was built with the intent of displaying approriately
across all devices, but I'm sure there are some environments where it
will look off a bit. If you notice anything on your setup, please let me
know so I can be sure it's accounted for.

## A Work in Progress
As you can see, this isn’t a finished product, but I can't let that stop me from
publishing it anymore. I’m certain there are bugs. I’m certain there are
better design decisions than the ones I've made. I'm certain that
I'll write some things poorly. I hope you’ll point out those things in 
a constructive manner so I can become a better developer, designer, writer 
and a more informed person. I hope you’ll take something from it too.
